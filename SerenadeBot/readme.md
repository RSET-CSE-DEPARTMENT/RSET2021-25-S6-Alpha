In our project, we aim to enhance music discovery and stress relief by leveraging advanced technology. So, we wish to create a chatbot-driven music recommendation system by integrating the last.fm API with a pretrained chatbot, we create a system that recommends music based on the user's mood expressed in their conversation with the chatbot. We achieve this by analyzing the tone and detecting emotions using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and other APIs if required for NLP (Natural Language Processing) with Python. We will also try to incorporate the use of Anvil to build Web user interfaces in Python. This innovative approach allows users to discover soothing music tailored to their emotions, ultimately providing a personalized and immersive listening experience. By harnessing the power of technology and music, we strive to improve well-being and enhance the way people interact with and enjoy music in their daily lives.
